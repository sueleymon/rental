# Rental Market Data Analysis Portfolio
Project Overview
The rental market is a dynamic and ever-evolving sector, offering a wealth of data through various online platforms. This portfolio project explores in-depth analysis of rental data to uncover valuable insights that can benefit a wide audience, including individuals like myself who are keen on making informed decisions about their next move.

Data Source
Immoscout 24: The primary data source, a part of well-known search engine companies like Autoscout 24. Although there's an API, a dataset from Kaggle was used for this analysis due to time constraints. The data's origin is the website, and it might have some missing or inaccurate information as it relies on user inputs.
Data Profile
Immoscout Data: This dataset covers the years 2018-2020 and provides essential information for prospective tenants looking for a new home.
Data Limitations and Ethics
Bias: The data itself isn't inherently biased as it reflects what's registered on the website. However, limited availability of datasets over time may affect the accuracy of some findings.
Manual Errors: Expect occasional input errors from users, resulting in missing values or varying responses. Efforts have been made to categorize them correctly.
Questions Explored
This analysis aims to address various questions, including:

What is the average/median monthly rent in a specific city or state?
Are there significant price differences between conditions of rental properties?
Are there correlations between property age and rental prices?
How does the heating type impact rent prices?
What factors contribute to fluctuations in rental prices?
